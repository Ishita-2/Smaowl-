		<p style="font-size:24px;">I went to Florida with my sister, Dad, and Mom. My parents took me there for my birthday. This is how it all started. One day my Dad handed me this book and it was a 2020 book about Disney and all of the rides there. Then he told me to read the book. I didn't quetion him beacaue I love to read so I took the book and started reading. Then a few days later my dad was packing bags and I am like, "Were are we going?" and he said ,"Disney World!!!" I was sooooo excited! :) The next day we were bording the plane. I still didn't finish the book so I read it on the plane to keep myself busy. A few hours later we arrived! The first thing we did was go to our hotel. We stayed in Vacation Village, in the resort we have to live like we are in a village. We have to do our own grocery shopping there is no room service, but it is still fun. The first day we went to Ebcot. Ebcot was my favorite park, the best part was the different countrys we visited. We ate lunch in Mexico and dinner in Japan. Those are just some of my experiences in Florida if you would like more just write it in the 'Feedback Form'.</p>
